abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new cellular technology introduced in 3GPP Release 13 for providing wide-area coverage for IoT. This article provides an overview of the air interface of NB-IoT. We describe how NB-IoT addresses key IoT requirements such as deployment flexibility, low device complexity, long battery lifetime, support of massive numbers of devices in a cell, and significant coverage extension beyond existing cellular technologies. We also share the various design rationales during the standardization of NB-IoT in Release 13 and point out several open areas for future evolution of NB-IoT.},

abstract = {By 2020, more than twenty five billion devices would be connected through wireless communications. In accordance with the rapid growth of the internet of things (IoT) market, low power wide area (LPWA) technologies have become popular. In various LPWA technologies, narrowband (NB)-IoT and long range (LoRa) are two leading technologies. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on NB-IoT and LoRa as efficient solutions connecting the devices. It is shown that unlicensed LoRa has advantages in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, licensed NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of QoS, latency, reliability, and range.},

abstract = {The advancement of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things (IoT) to scoop out untapped information and communication technology opportunities. It is anticipated that IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices to deliver plenty of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make our life more resourceful but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Consequently, there is a high demand for green communication to reduce energy consumption, which requires optimal resource availability and controlled power levels. In contrast to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources - memory, power, and computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to the need for efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics such as the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices spread over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such as LoRa and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the users. However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base station) that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed technology, narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology presents a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics like enhanced indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view of IoT and NBIoT, subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and energy-efficiency techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the NBIoT path to success are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel energy-efficient techniques 'zonal thermal pattern analysis' and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system have been proposed towards green IoT.},

@article{Ratasuk2016,
abstract = {In 3GPP, a narrowband system based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being introduced to support the Internet of Things. This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), can be deployed in three different operation modes-(1) stand-Alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. In stand-Alone operation mode, NB-IoT can occupy one GSM channel (200 kHz) while for in-band and guard-band operation modes, it will use one physical resource block of LTE (180 kHz). The design targets of NB-IoT include low-cost devices, high coverage (20-dB improvement over GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. The specifications for NB-IoT are expected to be finalized in 2016. In this paper, we describe the targets for NB-IoT and present a preliminary system design. In addition, coverage, capacity, latency, and battery life analysis are also presented.},

abstract = {OAPA The Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising technology which tends to revolutionize and connect the global world via heterogeneous smart devices through seamless connectivity. The current demand for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) has resulted in a variety of communication technologies with diverse service requirements to achieve the modern IoT vision. More recent cellular standards like Long-Term Evolution (LTE) have been introduced for mobile devices but are not well suited for low-power and low data rate devices such as the IoT devices. To address this, there is a number of emerging IoT standards. Fifth Generation (5G) mobile network, in particular, aims to address the limitations of previous cellular standards and be a potential key enabler for future IoT. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of the IoT application requirements along with their associated communication technologies are surveyed. Additionally, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) cellular-based Low-Power Wide Area (LPWA) solutions to support and enable the new service requirements for Massive to Critical IoT use cases are discussed in detail, including Extended Coverage Global System for Mobile Communications for the Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT), enhanced Machine-Type Communications (eMTC), and Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT). Furthermore, 5G New Radio (NR) enhancements for new service requirements and enabling technologies for the IoT are introduced. This paper presents a comprehensive review related to emerging and enabling technologies with main focus on 5G mobile networks that is envisaged to support the exponential traffic growth for enabling the IoT. The challenges and open research directions pertinent to the deployment of Massive to Critical IoT applications are also presented in coming up with an efficient context-aware congestion control (CACC) mechanism.},
